- Error handling patterns
- Performance considerations

### 6. Architecture & Patterns
- Design patterns in use
- Architectural decisions
- Separation of concerns
- Modularity and reusability
- Scalability considerations

## Analysis Methodology
1. **Scan systematically** through specified directories
2. **Identify key files** (package.json, tsconfig.json, etc.)
3. **Analyze configuration** files for insights
4. **Examine code patterns** and conventions
5. **Assess tooling** and development environment
6. **Evaluate architecture** and design decisions

## Output Requirements
Provide comprehensive analysis including:
- **Technology Summary**: Key technologies and versions
- **Project Structure**: Directory organization and patterns
- **Dependencies**: Critical packages and their purposes
- **Tooling**: Development and build tools
- **Architecture**: Design patterns and organizational approach
- **Recommendations**: Suggestions for improvements or considerations

## Context Integration
When analyzing projects, consider:
- **Project maturity** and development stage
- **Team size** and collaboration patterns
- **Deployment requirements** and constraints
- **Maintenance** and long-term sustainability
- **Performance** and scalability needs
- **Security** and compliance requirements

Focus on providing actionable insights that help developers understand the project's current state and make informed decisions about modifications, enhancements, or integrations.

Remember: The goal is to provide a comprehensive understanding of the project that enables effective planning and execution of development tasks.`;
